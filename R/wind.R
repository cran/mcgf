#' Ireland wind data, 1961-1978
#'
#' Daily average wind speeds for 1961-1978 at 11 synoptic meteorological
#' stations in the Republic of Ireland (Haslett and raftery 1989). Wind speeds
#' are in m/s. De-trended data sets are also provided.
#'
#' @name wind
#' @format `wind`: a list containing a data.frame with 6574 rows and 12 columns,
#' and a list of locations.
#'
#' @details
#' The data were obtained from the **gstat** package, and were modified so that
#' the first column is the time stamps. Locations of the 11 stations are given
#' in `wind_loc`. `wind_train` and `wind_test` contain de-trended and
#' square-root transformed train (1961-1970) and test (1971-1978) data sets.
#' See Gneiting et al. (2006) for de-trending details. `wind_trend` contains
#' the estimated annual trend and station-wise mean from the training dataset.
